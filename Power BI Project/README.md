# ⚡ Energy Consumption Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

---

## 🎯 Objective  
This task aims to develop a detailed, visually engaging dashboard to **monitor and analyze global energy consumption**. The dashboard evaluates key performance indicators (KPIs) to deliver insights that aid in **optimizing energy use and improving cost efficiency**.

---

## ❓ Analysis Conducted – Key Questions

1. 🌍 Which country generates the most electricity from **fossil fuels**?  
2. ☢️ What percentage of electricity from **nuclear sources** is generated by the **United States**?  
3. 🌱 How does **low-carbon electricity** usage compare between **Bhutan** and **Lesotho**?  
4. 💧 Which country has the **highest percentage of renewable energy** as equivalent primary energy?  
5. 💰 How has **GDP per capita** changed from **2010 to 2020**?  
6. 🌫️ What is the **trend in CO₂ emissions** from **2000 to 2020**?  
7. 🔋 Which country generates the most **electricity from nuclear sources**?  
8. 🇧🇷 What is the **percentage of electricity from renewables** in **Brazil**?

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
Steps taken to prepare the dataset:

- 🗑️ Removed unwanted columns from the `orders` table to reduce clutter.  
- ❌ Dropped the `users` table as it was irrelevant to the analysis.  
- 🚫 Removed the `status` column from the `returns` table due to lack of analytical value.

---

## 🔗 Data Modeling  
Modeling steps included:

- 🔄 Created **relationships** between the main energy dataset and related tables (e.g., carbon emissions) using common keys.  
- 📆 Added a **Date table** for accurate and consistent time-based filtering.  
- 📐 Developed a **Measure table** for centralizing calculated KPIs such as **Total Energy Consumption**, **Total Cost**, and **Carbon Emissions**.

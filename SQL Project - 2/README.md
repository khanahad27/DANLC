# Analyzing Student Performance
This Python project examines student performance using MySQL, MySQL-Connector-Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset provides critical insights into factors such as academic scores, attendance rates, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, study hours, and socio-economic influences on education. The analysis identifies key trends impacting student success, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and support systems to enhance learning outcomes.

# Data
The analysis uses a CSV file named Education_Data.csv, which should be placed in the root directory of the repository. The dataset includes information on Student ID, Name, Age, Gender, Grade Level, Math Score, English Score, Science Score, History Score, Attendance Rate, Participation Rate, Parental Involvement, Study Hours Per Week, Extracurricular Activities, Scholarship Status, Household Income, School Funding Level, Technology Access, Test Anxiety Level, and Future Plans.

# Analysis and Visualizations
 -> Handles missing values .
 
 -> Converts data types where necessary (e.g., date columns to datetime objects) .
 
 -> Drops irrelevant or mostly empty columns .

 # Exploratory Data Analysis:
 Generates various visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, providing insights into different aspects of the dataset:
 1. Grade Level Distribution
 2. Age Distribution By Gender
 3. English Score Distribution
 4. Average Math Score By Grade Level & Age
 5. Study Hours Per Week By Age
 6. Parental Involvement Distribution
 7. Extracurricular Activities By Gender
 8. Count Of Age By Gender and School Funding Level
 9. Participation Rate By Age
 10. Household Income Distribution By Scholarship Status
 11. Future Plans Distribution
 12. Unique IP Source By States
 13. Attendance Rate By Grade Level

# Conclusion:
 This study highlights patterns in student achievement, the impact of socio-economic factors, and variations in academic engagement. Key findings, such as the correlation between study hours and performance, the influence of parental involvement, and the role of school funding, emphasize the need for data-driven educational policies. These insights provide a foundation for improving learning environments and fostering academic success.

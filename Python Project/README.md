## 🧾 Key Findings & Conclusion

- 🧓 Patients range from **18 to 90 years**, with significant age-related trends in heart attack risk.  
- 🧬 **Cholesterol levels** average around **260 mg/dL**, posing elevated risk.  
- 🏋️‍♂️ Variations in **physical activity**, **BMI**, and **dietary patterns** directly influence cardiovascular health.  
- 🩸 **Heart attack risk** is elevated in approximately **36% of cases**, highlighting the critical need for **preventive care**.  
- 🧘‍♂️ Regions with **lower stress levels** and **healthier habits** show reduced cardiac risks.

> 💡 This analysis reinforces the importance of lifestyle adjustments and regular health monitoring to prevent cardiac conditions.

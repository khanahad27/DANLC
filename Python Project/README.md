# Traffic-Accident-Analysis
This Python project analyzes heart attack prediction data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset provides critical insights into factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, diabetes, smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, diet, stress levels, and their impact on heart attack risk. High risks of heart attacks are observed under specific conditions, emphasizing the need for targeted health interventions and preventive measures.

# Data
The analysis uses a CSV file named heart_attack_prediction_dataset.csv. This file should be placed in the root directory of the repository. The expected data includes information about Cholestrol Level, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Diabetes, Smoking, Obesity, Alcohol Consumption, Diet, Stress Level, Heart Attack Risk, BMI and other relevant statistics.

# Analysis and Visualizations
 -> Handles missing values .
 
 -> Converts data types where necessary (e.g., date columns to datetime objects) .
 
 -> Drops irrelevant or mostly empty columns .

 # Cardiac Health Analysis:
 Generates various visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, providing insights into different aspects of the dataset:
 1. Age Distribution by Country and Gender
 2. Patient Distribution by Continent
 3. Blood Pressure (Countries by Continent)
 4. Distribution of Cholesterol Levels
 5. Exercise Hours Per Week by Country
 6. Diet Distribution
 7. Heart Rate by Age
 8. Alcohol Consumption by Continent
 9. Average BMI (Country and Continent)
 10. Age Distribution by Smoking Status
 11. Obesity Status Distribution
 12. Average Heart Attack Risk Over Countries
 13. Stress Level by Country

# Conclusion:
 The analysis highlights key factors influencing heart health, including age, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits. Patients range from 18 to 90 years, with an average cholesterol level of 260 mg/dL. Lifestyle disparities, such as variations in physical activity, sedentary hours, and BMI, significantly impact heart attack risk, which is elevated in 36% of cases. These findings emphasize the importance of balanced habits and proactive health measures to mitigate cardiovascular risks.

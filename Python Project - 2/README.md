# Diabetes Insights
This Python project analyzes diabetes prediction data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset provides critical insights into factors such as cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar (HbA1c), genetic risk score, BMI, physical activity level, dietary habits, fast food intake, smoking, alcohol consumption, stress levels, screen time, sleep hours, and their impact on diabetes and prediabetes risk. High risks of diabetes are observed under specific conditions, emphasizing the need for targeted health interventions and preventive measures.

# Data
The analysis uses a CSV file named diabetes_dataset.csv. This file should be placed in the root directory of the repository. The expected data includes information about Cholesterol Level, Blood Pressure (Fasting Blood Sugar), HbA1c, Genetic Risk Score, BMI, Physical Activity Level, Diabetes, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Dietary Habits, Fast Food Intake, Stress Level, Screen Time, Sleep Hours, Region, Family Income, and Family History of Diabetes, along with other relevant statistics.

# Analysis and Visualizations
 -> Handles missing values .
 
 -> Converts data types where necessary (e.g., date columns to datetime objects) .
 
 -> Drops irrelevant or mostly empty columns .

 # Cardiac Health Analysis:
 Generates various visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, providing insights into different aspects of the dataset:
 1. Age Distribution By Gender
 2. Diabetes Distribution By Family History
 3. Average BMI By Regions & Parent Diabetes Type
 4. Distribution of Cholesterol Levels by Age
 5. Physical Activity Levels By Regions
 6. Dietary Habits Distribution
 7. Genetic Risk Score By Age
 8. Alcohol Consumption By Region
 9. Average Fasting Blood Sugar By Gender and Region
 10. Age Distribution By Smoking Status
 11. HbA1c(Blood Sugar Level) Status Distribution
 12. Count of Fast Food Intake Level
 13. Stress Level By Regions

# Conclusion:
 The dataset shows how health habits and risks vary by region, looking at factors like age, gender, BMI, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use. It shows a mix of people who are sedentary or active, with some having higher BMI, which can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. It also highlights differences in blood sugar, cholesterol, and prediabetes, emphasizing how lifestyle and genetics affect health.
